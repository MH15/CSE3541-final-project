How to play:
Arrow keys to move. If you fall off the edges, you go back to start. Try and find the Treasure Chest hidden in the maze. If you find it, the "next level" (another random maze) is loaded.

About:
I wanted to create a "dungeons" game feeling. I modeled low-poly assets in Blender, an open source 3d modeling program. I used a fog plane shader to create the feel as well as lighting. The stairs are not generated using maze generation algorithms, it is all visual. I experimented with 2.5D and 3D mazes but it was a bit too difficult.
